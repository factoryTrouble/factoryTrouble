;;; Test model for multiple window AGI use.
;;; This test uses two windows for one model.
;;; The model will first read the letter from
;;; one window then the other window will be 
;;; installed as the current device and the 
;;; model will read the letter from it.
;;;
;;; To run the example call the run-it function and
;;; provide the optional parameter as t to show
;;; the task in real windows.
