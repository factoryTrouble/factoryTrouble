;;; This example shows ACT-R being used more as a general
;;; programming tool instead of as a model of human
;;; cognition by creating a model that encapsulates the
;;; rules for a cell in Conway's Game of Life and then 
;;; creating many cells each using that model to operate.
;;;
;;; While this doesn't highlight the cognitive aspects
;;; of ACT-R it does demonstrate some of the more advanced
;;; programming aspects which one may need when creating tasks 
;;; for cognitive models, for example, working with more than
;;; one model at a time, the very basics of creating a new 
;;; device for a model, and adjusting the clock used for running
;;; a model in "real time".
;;;
;;; To run it call run-game and provide a width and height of 
;;; the board to use in cells:
;;;
;;; (run-game 10 10)
;;;
;;; I suggest keeping it fairly small because it will run 
;;; pretty slowly once the number of models gets "large" (large 
;;; of course is relative to the machine/Lisp running it).
;;; If using the ACT-R Environment to display the
;;; GUI window for the game I suggest keeping it
;;; to 30 cells or fewer since the multiple model support
;;; in the environment can really bog down with too many
;;; models simultaneoulsy defined. [Note: you will also need to
;;; enable multiple model support in the environment before using
;;; it to display the game.]
;;; 
;;; That will run the game for 10 seconds with
;;; one cycle per second displayed.  To continue
;;; running it you can just call run again and
;;; should include the real-time flag:
;;;
;;; (run 10 :real-time t)
;;;
;;; It's also possible to specify a longer or
;;; shorter initial run time with the cycles 
;;; keyword parameter:
;;;
;;; (run-game 10 10 :cycles 15)
;;;
;;; Would run the game for 15 cycles before stopping.
;;;
;;; Similarly, the display rate can be changed.
;;; The default is one second per cycle drawn,
;;; but specifying the speed keyword parameter
;;; allows you to change that faster or slower.
;;; Speed must be a positive number and specifies
;;; how many cycles to draw per second.
;;;
;;; (run-game 10 10 :speed 2)
;;;
;;; Would run the game for 10 cycles at 2 cycles
;;; drawn per second.  Note however that depending
;;; on the size of the board and the speed of the
;;; machine the game may not display as fast as
;;; requested.
;;; 
;;; In the graphic representation (the default)
;;; An "on" cell will show an @ symbol and an "off" 
;;; cell will be blank.  If one doesn't want to
;;; (or can't) use the grapic representation then
;;; a text only output can be drawn as well if
;;; the :text parameter is given as t:
;;;
;;; (run-game 10 10 :text t)
;;; 
;;; That will result in every cycle being drawn
;;; as two text arrays.  The first array will be
;;; on and off cells (* and . respectively) and
;;; the other will be the count of on neighbors
;;; for each cell.  Here's a representation of
;;; a cycle from a 10x10 game in text output:

;;; The default game starts with a random distribution
;;; of on cells where the probability of a cell being on
;;; can be specified by the :p parameter to run-game.  The
;;; default p is .25.
;;; 
;;; (run-game 10 10 :p .5)
;;;
;;; Finally, it is possible to manually configure the starting
;;; board when using the graphic representation by specifying 
;;; the :setup parameter as t:
;;;
;;; (run-game 10 10 :setup t)
;;;
;;; When that happens a random board will be generated, but
;;; the user can click on the cells to toggle them.  When 
;;; you are ready to run the model with the cell configuration
;;; created press the done button on the display.
;;; If one wants to setup initial states it can be useful to
;;; also specify :p as 0 or 1 to start with a board that is
;;; either all off or all on respectively.
