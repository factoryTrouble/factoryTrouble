;;; This is a simple example model to show the new options of
;;; clockwise and counterclockwise which can be used with the
;;; :nearest request parameter in a visual-location request.
;;; 
;;; The display is a clock face in an experiment window.  The
;;; model finds the top most number (12), attends to it, and
;;; then finds and attends to items clockwise until it returns
;;; to a number it has seen before.  Then, it switches to finding
;;; and attending to items counterclockwise until it again 
;;; returns to a previously seen number.
;;;
;;; The difference between this model and rotational-vision-test-1
;;; is that this model indicates the object around which it will
;;; rotate explicitly using the :center request parameter instead
;;; of using the point set with set-visual-center-point.
