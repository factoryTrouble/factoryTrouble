This is the ACT-R 7 source code distribution.

These directories contain all of the Lisp code needed to run ACT-R 7 and
also include a tutorial introduction to using ACT-R, a GUI for inspecting 
and debugging models called the ACT-R Environment, software documentation 
for ACT-R and the Environment, optional extensions which have been written 
for ACT-R, and also some example code showing ways of extending the system.

Instructions on how to load and run ACT-R and the ACT-R Environment can be
found in the QuickStart.txt file in the docs directory.  The tutorial units
are located in the tutorial directory, and that is the recommended starting 
point for those new to ACT-R.  More detailed information about the software 
can be found in the reference manual and the Environment manual which are 
located in the docs directory.

There is also a document called "differences-between-6-and-7" in the docs
directory which contains slides highlighting the most significant
differences between ACT-R 6 and ACT-R 7.

For more information or to download the most recent version of the ACT-R 
software please visit the ACT-R website at: <http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu>.
